## In case you were wondering why shortcut.life

<p>In many instances of my life I have heard the phrase "There is no shortcut for life" implying there is no substitute for hardwork.</p>

<p>Though I agree to this logic, I started to differ when I began talking to people around me. There are many people around us who we seldom notice who continue to input hardwork with little to no improvement in their stage or status.</p>

<p>My personal belief is this divide is contributed from the very basic concept of money and the invasion of corporates into our every day lives - who have imposed new technologies as a basic requirement which inturn affects those who are on the other side of the technological divide.</p>

<p>So shortcut.life is to create shortcuts to ease the life of people on the other side of this technological divide and enhancing the lives of people around me.</p>
